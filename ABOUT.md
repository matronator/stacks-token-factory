Create a dApp for users to create and deploy their own tokens on the Stacks Blockchain using our custom built no-code tool. At first it will be possible to make only fungible tokens, all implementing at least the SIP-10 trait, but in the future we want to add an option to launch NFTs and other types of contracts as well.

In the no-code tool you can define parameters you want your token to have, starting with the mandatory SIP-10 features, like total supply (if limited), name, symbol/ticker, etc. Then the token metadata like website and token logo/icon. And finally you can choose to include optional features, like the ability to mint or burn tokens and more.

Our tool will automatically generate the final Clarity code for the contract, which you will be able to review and then you can just deploy the contract to the network.

The service will be monetized, meaning you will have to pay a small cost (in addition to the default deployment fee), that will be based on the features you selected for your token. Meaning for instance mintable tokens will cost more than regular base SIP-10 tokens (ie. memecoins).

There will also be an option to reduce the cost of the token creation by giving us a certain percentage of the total supply upon the creation (this will be done automatically by including some code in the Clarity contract).

Thus the platform will earn by collecting STX for creating the tokens and also if chosen by collecting some amount of the newly created token, which will be very profitable if the token becomes popular and listed on exchanges.

In the future there are many more features planned, like creating tokens which can be stacked or mined, airdrops and more.
